# Python Number Operations

This Python program performs two tasks:
1. Determines whether a user-provided number is even or odd.
2. Calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 50.

## Features
- Accepts a numerical input from the user.
- Checks if the number is even or odd and displays the result.
- Handles invalid input using exception handling.
- Uses a loop to sum numbers from 1 to 50 and displays the total.

## How to Run the Program
1. Ensure you have Python installed (Python 3+ recommended).
2. Copy the script to a file (e.g., `script.py`).
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the script's directory.
4. Run the script using:
   ```sh
   python script.py
   ```

## Code Explanation
### **1. Even or Odd Checker**
- The program prompts the user for an integer.
- It checks if the number is divisible by 2.
- It prints whether the number is even or odd.
- If the user enters an invalid value (e.g., text), an error message is displayed.

### **2. Sum of Numbers from 1 to 50**
- The program initializes `total_sum` to 0.
- It iterates through numbers from 1 to 50, adding each to `total_sum`.
- It prints the final sum.

## Example Output
```
Enter a number: 7
7 is an odd number.
The sum of numbers from 1 to 50 is: 1275
```
